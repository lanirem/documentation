Pre Freesurfer pipeline

1. Gradient distortion correction.
2. Coregistration and averaging of T1w and T2w runs
3. ACPC (i.e. 6 dof) registration for T1w and T2w (FLIRT plus a customized script). The acpc registered distortion corrected T1w image is in the “native” volume space.
4. Initial brain extraction for T1w and T2w (FNIRT -atlas -based-brain-mask)
5. Field map distortion correction and registration of T2w to T1w using
a customized FLIRT BBR algorithm.
6. Bias field correction using sqrt(T1w X T2w)
7. Atlas registration (FLIRT linear + FNIRT nonlinear to MNI152)

MR functional Pipelines

1. Gradient distortion correction.
2. FLIRT -based motion correction using the “SBRef” volume as the target (
Smith SM et al ., submitted).
3. TOPUP -based field map preprocessing using Spin echo field map (for
Each day of each BOLD run)
4. Distortion correction and EPI to T1w registration of the “SBRef” volume using a customized FLIRT BBR algorithm for distortion correction and bbregister to fine tune the Reference Manual – 1200 Subjects Release (updated April 2018) | WU- Minn Consortium Human Connectome Project registration.
A Jacobian file representing the intensity modulations of the distortion
correction is stored but not applied to the data.
5. One step spline resampling from the original EPI frames to atlas space including all transforms (motion, EPI distortion, EPI to T1w
from FLIRT BBR, fine tuning of EPI to T1w with bbregister, nonlinear T1w to MNI)
6. Intensity normalization to mean of 10000 (like in FEAT) and bias field removal.
